Instructions to set up environment to run this experiment:
----------------------------------------------------------

1) Navigate to “gym/envs/classic_control”, replace the existing “cartpole.py” with the
file with same name from the files attached.
2) Navigate to “gym/envs”, replace “_init_.py” with the file with same name from the
files attached.
3) Change the values of max_episode_steps and reward_threshold to the number of timesteps
that you want to test for in the lines 56 & 57 of the “_init_.py” file.(eg:
max_episode_steps = 60000)
4) Install “Keras” library by using the command “sudo pip install keras” from command
line.
Instructions to run python code for different cases of noise settings:
1)To add the random seed, enter the seed value in line 15 of “cartpolePlayer.py”
2)For no noise case, run the code by executing the command “python3 ./cartpolePlayer”
using command line after navigating to folder where project is located.
3) For Uniform 5% actuator, uncomment the lines 61 & 64 and run the program using the
command from the previous step.
4) Similarly, uncomment the lines according to the cases as follows and run the program
by using the command mentioned above:
Uniform 10% actuator – 61 & 64 and replace 0.05 with 0.1 in line 61
Uniform 5% sensor – 126 & 127
Uniform 10% sensor – 126 & 127 and replace 0.05 with 0.1 in line 126
Gaussian σ2 = 0.1 sensor – 121 & 128
Gaussian σ2 = 0.2 sensor - 121 & 128 and change the value of variance to 0.2 in line
121
